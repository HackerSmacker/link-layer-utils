Link Layer Utils

This repository is intended to provide some utility programs that will be useful in aiding their operator troubleshoot, test, and evaluate the 
competence of custom network cards. By "custom network cards," I am primarily referring to non-Ethernet network interfaces -- this includes,
but is not limited to:
- KISS TNCs connected via async
- HDLC over async
- traditional Serial Line IP (SLIP) over async
- PPP over async
- raw AX.25 frames over async
- SDLC to and from IBM 3174 establishment controller boxes

Hopefully these are useful to at least someone; I tried to make these as simple as possible!

Included programs:
- kissencap: encapsulate arbitrary data into a KISS frame, for transmission via an amateur radio packet TNC.
- slipencap: encapsulate IP frames (from a pipe) into a SLIP frame, useful for testing SLIP stacks on embedded systems.
- hdlcencap: encapsulate arbitrary data into an HDLC frame


(SOME OF THESE HAVE NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN!)
